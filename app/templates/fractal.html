    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>A simple program to randomly generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lindenmayer-sytle fractal trees</a>. Every time you visit this page, a new tree is generated at random. This started as an experiment playing with recursive functions, Python's Turtle module, and randomness and has morphed into what you see here.</p>

    <p>By its very nature, the work you see above is ephemeral. No one has seen this unique tree before and you will never be able to see it again after leaving this page. The image above is not saved on my server and I will never see it. It is yours and yours alone to see.</p>

    <p>Don't like the tree you got? <a href="{{ url_for('display_tree') }}">Try another!</a></p>
